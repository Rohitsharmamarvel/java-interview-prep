Abstraction

Interface vs Abstract class

Composition vs Inheritance

IS-A vs HAS-A

SOLID principles (basics)


String (Always Asked)

String literal vs new String

String Pool

Why String is immutable

== vs equals()

String vs StringBuilder vs StringBuffer

intern()

What happens when strings are concatenated

Why String is good HashMap key


equals() & hashCode()

Contract rules

Why both are needed

What happens if overridden incorrectly

Mutable fields problem


Collections Framework (VERY IMPORTANT)

List vs Set vs Map

ArrayList vs LinkedList

HashMap internal working

HashMap vs ConcurrentHashMap

TreeMap vs HashMap

Fail-fast vs Fail-safe

Comparator vs Comparable

Immutability in collections


Exception Handling

Checked vs Unchecked

Custom exceptions

Best practices

Exception vs Error


Multithreading & Concurrency (Asked at 4 YOE)

Thread lifecycle

Runnable vs Callable

synchronized keyword

volatile keyword

ExecutorService

Thread pools

Future vs CompletableFuture

Deadlock, race condition

Atomic variables

Concurrent collections


Java 8+ (MANDATORY)

Lambda expressions

Functional interfaces

Stream API (filter, map, reduce, collect)

Intermediate vs terminal operations

Optional

Method references

Parallel streams (when to avoid)


JVM Internals (Basic level)

Class loading

Garbage collection basics

Types of GC (G1, Parallel)

Memory leaks causes

Heap tuning basics

2️⃣ SPRING & SPRING BOOT (CRITICAL)

Spring Core

What is Spring

IOC & DI

Bean lifecycle

@Component vs @Service vs @Repository

@Autowired (constructor vs field injection)

@Qualifier

Singleton vs Prototype scope


Spring Boot Core

Why Spring Boot

Auto-configuration

Starter dependencies

application.properties vs application.yml

Profiles

Embedded Tomcat

@SpringBootApplication


REST APIs (Asked in Every Interview)

@RestController

@RequestMapping vs @GetMapping

@PathVariable vs @RequestParam

@RequestBody

ResponseEntity

HTTP methods & status codes

Idempotency

Pagination & sorting


Exception Handling

@ControllerAdvice

@ExceptionHandler

Global vs local exception handling


Validation

@Valid

@NotNull, @Size, @Email

Custom validators


Spring Data JPA / Hibernate (VERY IMPORTANT)

Entity lifecycle

@Entity vs @Table

Primary keys strategies

OneToOne, OneToMany, ManyToOne

FetchType.LAZY vs EAGER

Cascade types

JPQL vs Native query

Pagination

Transactions

@Transactional

N+1 problem

Optimistic vs pessimistic locking


Spring Boot Advanced

Filters vs Interceptors

AOP (what, why, where used)

@Async

Scheduling (cron)

Caching (Redis, @Cacheable)

Spring Events


Security (Basic to Medium)

Authentication vs Authorization

Spring Security flow

JWT token flow

Filter chain

PasswordEncoder



---

3️⃣ MICROSERVICES (COMMON AT 4 YOE)

Monolith vs Microservices

Inter-service communication

RestTemplate vs WebClient

Feign Client

Circuit breaker (Resilience4j)

Retry & timeout

Distributed tracing

Config management

Service discovery



---

4️⃣ DATABASE (EXPECTED)

SQL vs NoSQL

Indexing

Normalization

ACID properties

Isolation levels

Transactions

Deadlocks

Pagination strategies



---

5️⃣ SYSTEM DESIGN (HIGH-LEVEL EXPECTATION)

Functional vs Non-functional requirements

Load balancing

Caching strategies

Database scaling

Message queues

Async processing

Idempotency

Rate limiting

CAP theorem

High availability



---

🔥 INTERVIEW REALITY CHECK

At 4 years, interviewer checks:

Do you know WHY, not just WHAT

Have you handled failures

Can you explain trade-offs

Can you design simple scalable systems



---

✅ NEXT STEP (Recommended Order)

1️⃣ Java Collections + Multithreading
2️⃣ Spring Boot + JPA deep dive
3️⃣ REST + Exception handling
4️⃣ AWS (SQS, SNS, EC2)
5️⃣ System Design scenarios

If you want, next I can:

Drill Java Collections deep-dive

Drill Spring Boot + JPA most tricky questions

Do mock interview Q&A like real interviews


Just tell me what to start next.
