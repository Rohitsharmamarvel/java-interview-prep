# 🚀 COMPLETE BACKEND + SYSTEM DESIGN ROADMAP (FINAL)
## 0 → 4+ YOE | 2-Month Intensive | SDE-2 / Team Lead Ready

---

## HOW TO USE THIS ROADMAP (IMPORTANT)

- This is **linear**. Do NOT jump.
- Each phase builds the thinking required for the next.
- Goal is not mastery of everything — goal is **clear mental models**.
- By the end, you should be able to:
  - Design systems
  - Explain trade-offs
  - Build something real
  - Crack interviews confidently

---

# 🧱 PHASE 0 — HOW THE INTERNET & BACKEND REALLY WORK (Days 1–4)

### Goal
Stop treating backend & system design as magic.

### Topics
- What is a client–server system
- API vs Web Service
- HTTP request lifecycle (DNS → LB → Server → DB → Response)
- HTTP methods & status codes
- REST principles (why stateless)
- HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/2 vs HTTP/3 (high level)
- TCP vs UDP (reliability vs speed)
- DNS resolution flow
- Latency vs Throughput
- Serialization: JSON vs XML vs Protobuf

### You should be able to answer
- Why REST is stateless
- Why HTTP over raw sockets
- Where latency actually comes from

---

- Filter chain
- Password hashing
- CORS
- SQL Injection & XSS prevention

---

# 🧬 PHASE 4 — MICROSERVICES & FAILURE THINKING (Days 29–36)

### Goal
Design for failure, not happy paths.

### Topics

# 🧠 FINAL MENTAL SHIFT (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Stop asking:
> Which is the best approach?

Start asking:
> Given these constraints, what is acceptable?

This is how:
- Team leads think
- Architects think
- AI-proof engineers think

---

## AFTER 2 MONTHS — YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO
- Design systems end-to-end
- Explain trade-offs confidently
- Build at least one solid backend project
- Clear system design interviews
- Think like an owner, not a coder

---

## NEXT STEP
- Pick **one system** (URL shortener / chat / feed)
- Design it
- Build it
- Explain it

That’s how you change your life.
